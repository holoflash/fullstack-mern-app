                This is a full-stack website I have built using the MERN stack
                (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The backend is hosted
                on MongoDB Atlas, and the site is deployed via{' '}
                <a href="https://render.com/">https://render.com</a>. I'm
                currently using Firebase for user authentication, and SASS for
                styling.

            <h4>ROADMAP:</h4>
            <p>
                This site was built while learning how to use the MERN stack but
                is quickly evolving into a real passion project. The idea is to
                build a platform for Spotify Playlist curators to receive song
                submissions in a more organic way than what is currently
                available online.
            </p>
            <details>
                <summary>The most immediate things to work on:</summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Rewrite the JavaScript to TypeScript in strict mode for
                        a better development experience moving forward
                    </li>
                    <li>Rebuild using Vite to streamline and reduce bloat</li>
                </ul>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>And a little further ahead:</summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>Have two distinct user types - Curator & User</li>
                    <li>Restructure the backend to allow multiple curators</li>
                    <li>Allow Users to log in using Spotify</li>
                    <li>
                        Allow Users to search for songs to submit using the
                        Spotify API
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use the Spotify API to allow Curators to add the
                        playlists they want to have on the platform
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Implement Curator options to automatically add songs to
                        their playlists based on song rating thresholds.
                    </li>
                </ul>
